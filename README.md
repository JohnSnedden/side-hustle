# SideHustle

This repo project is a web client for a simple Point of Sale (POS) system. A second repo exists for a corresponding backend database and API

## Background
This is my second project as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program.

We were given the freedom to choose what to develop.

I chose to develop a lightweight quoting tool for freelance workers to quote potential customers.

## Wireframes
Initial low-res hand sketch client wireframes and storyboard are located here

## User Stories
I utilized a Trello board https://trello.com/b/Q5Jj1zlN/wdi-project-4-fe-framework to keep track of my user stories, progress, and bugs/issues during initial development. After initial development is complete I will switch to using the GitHub repo issues list for ongoing issue management.

## Future Development
There is a lot of scope for building out this product. Projects and Estimates need to be added, then there is always the option of tracking the time worked on the projects. That could also open the possibility to billing.
